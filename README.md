### Clean Code, Human Readable Code

After we leave the project, 
other developers work on the project
to make our codes understandable for them, 
we make our codes clear by:

* Leave some comments
* Leave some space between 
* Don't code too much lines in a single sheet
* Follow `modular programming` and make partition in separate sheets.
* Organize your `folder structure` 
* Prevent nesting folders into each other too much!
* Name folders a meaningful name that make sense for human.
